# cat-climbers-unity
2D co-op climbing game prototype created for the CMPTGCS 130H course at UCSB.

Two players control cats climbing up a mountain. Keep going up and see how long you can survive!

The environment is procedurally generated. As time goes on, new hazards start appearing in the level.

Intended to be played with two XBOX controllers.
